Digital Logic Design Project:
Fast Multipliers - Shift and add Multiplication Algorithm vs Wallace Tree Multiplier 
This project designs and compares two digital multiplier architectures — **Shift-and-Add Multiplier** and **Wallace Tree Multiplier** — in terms of **design complexity**, **performance**, and **hardware efficiency**.
## Features

- 32-bit signed multiplication
-  Overflow detection
-  FSM-based control for Shift-and-Add
-  Gate count and delay analysis (Shift-and-Add and wallace tree)
-  Modular design in SystemVerilog
-  Testbench for correctness verification

**Simulation**
Use any SystemVerilog-compatible simulator like ModelSim, Vivado, or online tools (EDA Playground).
